# Python First Excersises - Freecodecamp.org

Welcome to one of my very firsts projects for learning and developing Python programming language.
Here you'll find some games and entry-level excersises from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) based on [Kylie Ying](https://github.com/kying18)'s YouTube tutorial (https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg).

## Description

This project consists of four Python-based games.
They're all working 100% perfectly, so I invite you to have some fun and try this simply awesome games! :grin:

All games were made using [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. I considered this the best way to learn and improve this great programming language, taking these games as a 101 introduction to the Developing and Programming world.

In this repository you will find:

- _Hangman_, in where you have to find the missing word's letters (you have 7 lives!). :nerd_face:
- _Madlibs_, so you can have fun by completing blanks with nonsense before reading it out loud .
- _Rock-Paper-Scissors_, where you can defy the computer to beat you. In this folder, you can also find a _Guess the number_ game, in which you'll have to guess a computer's-chosen number (and the computer can also guess your choice!)
- _Tic-Tac-Toe_, in which the computer's player is undefeatable! (it's been improved with AI components). :grimacing:

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/) is a pre-requisite.
- [Terminal] of your computer.

### Installing and Using

- Download the project from this repository
- Run [git bash](https://git-scm.com/) (or any other) terminal on the project's folder
- Locate at the game's folder in your computer (by using `cd`, `cd (foldername)` and `ls` commands on your terminal)
- Run `python3` on the terminal, followed by the selected game's name to iniciate the game execution

You're ready to play! :smile:

### Executing games

The games are programmed to function with your terminal commands, and mostly involves using arrow keys, numbers and the Enter/Return key.
